How to write qasm and measurement files (examples are provided as well):

1. Each qasm file's first line must be the number of qubits in the circuit

2. Each successive line can be chosen from the following
	- Act on a qubit with an operator
		-The following operators are already supported by the library:
		CNOT, SWAP, Hadamard, Rx(theta), Ry(theta), Rz(theta), X, Y, Z, Depolarizing Noise Channel, CRk
		-A two qubit operation looks like the following line: "CNOT 0 1" where 0 is the index of the control qubit
		-A one qubit operation looks like: "H 0" or "Rz 3.14159 0"
	- Define a new 1 or 2 qubit operator
		-The following line defines a one qubit operator: "def1 Q q.gate"
			-The numbers (imaginary are not supported) in the matrix "Q" must be found in the file: "q.gate"
			-After this definition, Q can be called just like any other one qubit gate: "Q 0"
		-The following line defines a two qubit operator: "def2 Cz cz.gate"
			-The numbers (imaginary are not supported) in the matrix "Cz" must be found in the file: "cz.gate"
			-After this definition, Q can be called just like any other two qubit gate: "Cz 0 1"
		-Note that definition of an arbitrary operator does not support extra arguments as in Rz, Ry, and Rx
			
3. Measurement files must also be provided
	-A measurement file consists of X,Y,Z,0,1, or T measurements separated by spaces
	-If 5 measurements are included and an 8 qubit circuit is simulated, the rest of the qubits will be automatically traced out

4. Things to Note:
	-The qubits will always start in the all-zero pure state
	-If your qasm files are incorrect, the tensor library will not simulate them and may crash
